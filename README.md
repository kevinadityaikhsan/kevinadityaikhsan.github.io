## Projects
### [E-commerce Churn Prediction](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/e-commerce-churn-prediction)
Addresses the challenge of customer churn for Treepedia, a leading e-commerce company. Leveraging a diverse dataset of customer demographics, purchase history, and behavioral metrics, developed a predictive model using tree-based algorithms (decision trees, random forests, XGBoost) to identify customers at high risk of churn. The goal was to enable proactive retention strategies and minimize revenue loss.
### [Transjakarta Data Analysis](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/transjakarta-data-analysis)
Data analysis project focuses on optimizing the Transjakarta Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Jakarta to improve efficiency, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction. By leveraging historical ridership data, identified peak demand patterns, analyzed passenger demographics, and explored route optimization strategies. The insights gained from this analysis informed recommendations for enhancing Transjakarta's service delivery.
### [Album Store CRUD](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/album-store-crud)
Demonstrates my proficiency in developing command-line applications with practical features. Built an album store application using Python and the tabulate module, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing album inventory. Additionally, Integrated a shopping cart feature, allowing users to browse, add albums to their cart, and simulate the purchasing process. This project showcases my ability to create user-friendly interfaces and implement core functionalities for real-world applications.
### [Rock Paper Scissor Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevinadityaikhsan/cnn-model-of-rock-paper-scissor)
Developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model using TensorFlow to recognize hand gestures representing rock, paper, or scissors. The model leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract relevant features from hand images and accurately classify them.

### [Deploying Llama 3.1 on Google Cloud Platform](https://medium.com/@kevinadityaikhsan15/deploying-llama-3-1-on-google-cloud-platform-abe802fc1631)
This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of deploying Llama 3.1, Meta AI's open-source large language model, on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). By utilizing GCP's robust infrastructure and seamless integration with Colab Enterprise, users can harness the power of Llama 3.1 for various AI applications. The guide outlines the prerequisites, including a GCP account and basic familiarity with GCP concepts. It then details the deployment process, starting with enabling Vertex AI, selecting Llama 3.1 from the Model Garden, configuring deployment settings, and monitoring the progress. Once deployed, users can access Llama 3.1 within Colab Enterprise notebooks for experimentation and development. The guide also offers tips on choosing appropriate machine types for optimal performance and cost management.

### [Exploring the Types of Machine Learning: Supervised vs. Unsupervised](https://medium.com/@kevinadityaikhsan15/exploring-the-types-of-machine-learning-supervised-vs-unsupervised-9642c14a8399)
This article discusses Machine Learning. It briefly mentions the four main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is a technique where the data is labeled. This labeled data is used to train a model to identify patterns and make predictions. Unsupervised learning is the opposite; the data is not labeled. The machine must find the patterns on its own. Unsupervised learning is useful for tasks like anomaly detection and classification.

### [Understanding Parametric and Non-Parametric Statistics](https://medium.com/@kevinadityaikhsan15/understanding-parametric-and-non-parametric-statistics-d3725be26829)
This comprehensive article explores the distinctions between parametric and non-parametric statistical tests, their underlying assumptions, and their respective strengths and limitations. Parametric tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, rely on assumptions of normal data distribution and homogeneous variance, offering increased statistical power when these conditions are met. Conversely, non-parametric tests, including the Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test, are distribution-free and robust to outliers, making them suitable for non-normal or ordinal data, especially with smaller sample sizes. Choosing the appropriate test depends on the specific characteristics of the data and research questions, and this article provides a valuable guide for making informed decisions in statistical analysis.

### [Unraveling the Efficiency: Comparing Nested Data Structures in Python](https://medium.com/@kevinadityaikhsan15/unraveling-the-efficiency-comparing-nested-data-structures-in-python-8039fd4aeea6)
This technical analysis examines the performance implications of various nested data structures in Python, including lists within lists, dictionaries within dictionaries, and combinations thereof. Through empirical testing using the timeit module, the study demonstrates a significant difference in element access speed among these structures. Lists within lists exhibit the fastest performance, while lists containing dictionaries are the least efficient. These findings underscore the importance of carefully selecting data structures to align with anticipated access patterns, thereby optimizing code execution time and overall efficiency.

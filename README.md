## Projects
### [Tomato Leaf Disease Classification](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/tomato_leaf_disease_classification)
A lightweight and accurate image classification model for early disease detection in tomato crops. Emphasizing both efficiency and performance, the model leverages transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 and data augmentation to achieve a remarkable 97.43% accuracy on a diverse dataset encompassing 10 disease classes and healthy leaves. Streamlined Docker deployment using TensorFlow Serving facilitates seamless integration into various platforms, empowering growers and agricultural professionals with a valuable tool for proactive crop management and yield optimization.
### [Olist Customers Segmentation](https://github.com/PurwadhikaDev/JaguarGroup_DTI_01_FinalProject)
Conducted an in-depth customer segmentation analysis for Olist, utilizing LRFM analysis and K-means clustering. The analysis identified four distinct customer segments, each with unique characteristics and purchasing behaviors: New Customers characterized by low engagement across all metrics; Hibernating Customers with a long history but recent inactivity; Champions representing a small but high-value segment with active engagement and high transaction value; and Potential Loyalists demonstrating moderate engagement across all metrics, indicating potential for increased loyalty. The study concluded by proposing tailored marketing strategies for each segment, aiming to enhance customer engagement, foster loyalty, and drive sustained growth for Olist.
### [Sentiment Analysis and Classification of ruangguru's Clash of Champions YouTube Comments](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/ruangguru-sentiment-analysis-classification)
This project involved sentiment analysis and text classification of YouTube comments from ruangguru's Clash of Champions. The best performing model achieved 93.8% accuracy and demonstrated the potential for automated comment analysis and sentiment identification. While there is room for improvement in addressing class imbalance and enhancing preprocessing, the project successfully showcases a valuable tool for understanding audience engagement. Additionally, testing on new comments from episode 4 yielded a 93.6% accuracy, suggesting strong generalization capabilities.
### [E-commerce Churn Prediction](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/e-commerce-churn-prediction)
Data-driven approach to address customer churn for Treepedia, an e-commerce company facing high churn rates. The project involved developing and optimizing an XGBoost machine learning model to predict customer churn. The final model achieved 93% accuracy and resulted in a significant 31.3% increase in profit compared to a no-model scenario. Highlighted key factors influencing churn, such as tenure, complaints, and warehouse-to-home distance. The insights gained from this project empower Treepedia to implement targeted retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and ultimately boost profitability.
### [Transjakarta Data Analysis](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/transjakarta-data-analysis)
Data analysis project focuses on optimizing the Transjakarta Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Jakarta to improve efficiency, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction. By leveraging historical ridership data, identified peak demand patterns, analyzed passenger demographics, and explored route optimization strategies. The insights gained from this analysis informed recommendations for enhancing Transjakarta's service delivery.

A step-by-step guide to deploying Llama 3.1 on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Leverage GCP's infrastructure and Colab Enterprise integration for AI applications. Outlines prerequisites, enabling Vertex AI, selecting the model, configuring deployment, and accessing it within Colab Enterprise. Tips on machine type selection included. 
### [Exploring the Types of Machine Learning: Supervised vs. Unsupervised](https://medium.com/@kevinadityaikhsan15/exploring-the-types-of-machine-learning-supervised-vs-unsupervised-9642c14a8399)

![Machine Learning](/assets/image/Machine-learning-def-.png)

Machine Learning encompasses four main types: supervised (labeled data), unsupervised (unlabeled data), semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning trains models for prediction using labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, aiding tasks like anomaly detection and classification. 
### [Understanding Parametric and Non-Parametric Statistics](https://medium.com/@kevinadityaikhsan15/understanding-parametric-and-non-parametric-statistics-d3725be26829)

Parametric and non-parametric statistical tests are distinguished by their underlying assumptions. Parametric tests, such as t-tests, necessitate normal data distribution and provide greater power when these conditions are met. On the other hand, non-parametric tests, like the Mann-Whitney U test, are distribution-free and robust to outliers, rendering them suitable for non-normal or ordinal data, particularly with smaller sample sizes. Test selection hinges on the specific data characteristics and research questions. 
### [Unraveling the Efficiency: Comparing Nested Data Structures in Python](https://medium.com/@kevinadityaikhsan15/unraveling-the-efficiency-comparing-nested-data-structures-in-python-8039fd4aeea6)

![Python](/assets/image/pythondatastructuresmin.png)

Empirical testing in Python reveals a significant difference in element access speed among various nested data structures. Lists within lists exhibit the fastest performance, whereas lists containing dictionaries prove the least efficient. Prudent selection of data structures based on anticipated access patterns optimizes code execution time and overall efficiency.

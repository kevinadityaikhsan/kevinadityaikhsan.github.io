## Projects
### [E-commerce Churn Prediction](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/e-commerce-churn-prediction)
Addresses the challenge of customer churn for Treepedia, a leading e-commerce company. Leveraging a diverse dataset of customer demographics, purchase history, and behavioral metrics, developed a predictive model using tree-based algorithms (decision trees, random forests, XGBoost) to identify customers at high risk of churn. The goal was to enable proactive retention strategies and minimize revenue loss.
### [Transjakarta Data Analysis](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/transjakarta-data-analysis)
Data analysis project focuses on optimizing the Transjakarta Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in Jakarta to improve efficiency, resource allocation, and customer satisfaction. By leveraging historical ridership data, identified peak demand patterns, analyzed passenger demographics, and explored route optimization strategies. The insights gained from this analysis informed recommendations for enhancing Transjakarta's service delivery.
### [Album Store CRUD](https://github.com/kevinadityaikhsan/album-store-crud)
Demonstrates my proficiency in developing command-line applications with practical features. Built an album store application using Python and the tabulate module, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing album inventory. Additionally, Integrated a shopping cart feature, allowing users to browse, add albums to their cart, and simulate the purchasing process. This project showcases my ability to create user-friendly interfaces and implement core functionalities for real-world applications.
### [Rock Paper Scissor Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevinadityaikhsan/cnn-model-of-rock-paper-scissor)
Developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model using TensorFlow to recognize hand gestures representing rock, paper, or scissors. The model leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract relevant features from hand images and accurately classify them.
